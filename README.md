This repository powers [Michael Shawn Lockwood‚Äôs GitHub Pages site](https://michaelshawnlockwood.github.io) ‚Äî a living portfolio of SQL Server engineering, modern data engineering projects, code examples, and technical writing.

## üåê About the Site
The site is powered by Jekyll and Minimal Mistakes, with custom SCSS/SASS, JavaScript, Liquid, and YAML configuration, plus inline HTML/SVG for data visualizations.

This site is not a static resume. It‚Äôs a **working portfolio** that demonstrates:
- Hands-on database administration and development experience.
- Data engineering workflows (ETL pipelines, orchestration, analytics).
- A philosophy of treating a career like **data**: modeling roles, measuring intensities, and visualizing trends.

Content includes:
- Resume highlights and a career timeline.
- Blog posts on SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Airflow, Databricks, Azure, AWS.
- Custom SVG visualizations like the **Roles Over Time area chart**.
- Open-source automation frameworks and DBA utilities.

- ## üõ†Ô∏è Built With
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for development
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator
- [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme (dark skin, customized SCSS)
- Custom **SVG diagrams** with layered `<path>` and `<polyline>`
- Custom **SASS/SCSS** overrides for styles
- Custom **JavaScript** for chart logic and interactivity
- **YAML** for configuration and data files
- **Liquid** templating for layouts and includes
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for continuous deployment
- Markdown + HTML5 for content and structure

## üìä Featured Work
- **Roles Over Time Chart**  
  An SVG visualization that translates 25+ years of resume history into measurable signals for Dev, DBA, ETL, and Analysis. Bands rise and fall as responsibilities shift ‚Äî a data model of a career.

- **NYC Taxi Pipeline Project**  
  A real-world data engineering flow: Parquet validation ‚Üí PSV conversion ‚Üí schema generation ‚Üí SQL Server/PostgreSQL bulk insert. Downstream: orchestration with Airflow and Databricks, visualization with Power BI.

- **SQLAgent007**  
  A cross-platform automation framework for intelligent index tuning, performance surveillance, and DBA task orchestration.

## üí° Philosophy
This project is about more than publishing a resume. It demonstrates:
- Turning narrative into **data** and visualizations  
- Showcasing **real artifacts**: code, diagrams, utilities  
- Valuing **clarity over buzzwords** in how experience is represented  
- Bridging **DBA, Dev, and Data Engineering** in practice
