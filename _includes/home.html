          <h3 id="about-summary">About</h3>
            <p>I have been a database developer my entire adult life. I began with Microsoft Access while in college. Naturally, I 
              migrated to SQL Server using Microsoft's Data Transformation Services (DTS), earning my MCDBA certification in 2006. SQL Server and SSIS have been my foundation 
              for more than 2 decades.
            </p>
            <p>Once Walmart Health's acquisition of MeMD was final, I took the opportunity to invest in furthering my education 
              and improving upon my technical skillset through independent project work. One outcome is a real-world multi-billion 
              row public data engineering pipeline focused on large-scale data ingestion, validation, and analytics across SQL 
              Server and PostgreSQL, separately for a number of reasons. I use Python and PowerShell for converting parquet files 
              into PSV format, then bulk import into relational tables. GitHub and VS Code provide version control and development 
              workflow. Airflow is used to orchestrate repeatable pipelines, while Databricks supports distributed analytics. 
              Results are published for visualization in Power BI, ensuring reproducibility and automation end-to-end.
            </p>
            <p>I enjoy working in fast-paced environments and have many years of experience in healthcare and other transaction-heavy 
              industries. While I am a firm believer in mastering core platforms and technologies rather than a generalist of many, 
              I’ve also taken time to learn and experiment with a variety of others—Python, PowerShell, JavaScript, D3.js, Power BI, 
              ASP.NET Core, Identity Server, Node.js, Angular, CSS/Sass, and even MongoDB. These explorations help me stay adaptable 
              and give me perspective, many of which I continue to use in my recurring development and deployment cycles.

          <p class="section-subtitle">Dev, DBA, ETL &amp; Analysis — relative intensity by year</p>
          <p>Here’s what the graphic shows: it maps my career (1997–present) as time-varying focus across four hats—Dev, 
            DBA, ETL, and Business-data Analysis. The heights are relative intensity per year, not percentages, so more 
            than one role can be high at once. Because every DBA stint also included hands-on development, the DBA band 
            lives within the broader Dev through-line, while ETL appears as intermittent spikes and then drops to zero 
            after 2021. A thin Analysis band runs across the bottom to reflect continuous—but varying—business-data work 
            (separate from DB administration, performance tuning, and development). The dashed segment after 2021 marks 
            independent project work that keeps Dev and Analysis active while DBA/ETL duties pause.</p>

      <h3 class="section-subtitle">What I’m Looking For</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          I’m seeking not only the right role but also the right environment—one where leadership provides 
          clear guardrails without suffocating innovation, where policies are practical rather than bureaucratic, 
          and where ideas from any level can make their way to the table. In that kind of culture, I contribute 
          best: combining 20+ years of SQL Server expertise with a bias for performance, automation, and verifiable, reliable results.</p>
        <p>
          I’m targeting Senior Database Developer / DBA / Database Engineer roles that require extensive SQL Server experience—query tuning, indexing 
          strategy, performance analysis, and HA/DR (FCIs, Always On availability Groups, replication, log shipping)—with 
          standardized change control and real observability (tested backups, rehearsed restores, explicit RPO/RTO). SSIS is a core 
          tool; I’ve built enterprise-class ETL pipelines with it. I support DACPAC-based deployments 
          via Visual Studio (SSDT). T-SQL is my second language. I design and develop application-ready result sets—procedures, 
          functions, views, window functions—and, when appropriate, **automate and instrument** the platform.</p>
        <p>I’m evolving with the industry—engaging with Azure SQL and SQL Server on Azure VMs, Airflow, Databricks, and AWS—and I’ve added PostgreSQL 
          to my list of platforms. I am also closing in on Airflow &amp; Databricks. My working sandbox is practical and current: VS Code; GitHub; Hyper-V, 
          VirtualBox, and Docker for disposable labs; WSFC &amp; SQL Server FCI; Linux VMs (openSuSE Leap/Debian) for PostgreSQL and tooling; Python, PowerShell 
          and Bash for scripting and automation; plus selective .NET/Identity Server, and REST APIs (Postman). I use front-end tooling (Angular/React/Sass/SVG) 
          for architecting full stacks plus instrument, diagnose, and box — and to present, test, and, most importantly, understand. The through-line is straightforward: 
          ship fast, safe, measurable changes to production databases. Ultimately, the broader toolchain is how I deliver; my core work lives in the data tier.</p>

          <h3>By &ldquo;instrument,&rdquo; I mean:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Procedure-level telemetry:</strong> log start/end, duration, row counts, error codes, and a correlation ID (via <code>SESSION_CONTEXT</code>) into a lean telemetry table.</li>
            <li><strong>Extended Events &amp; Query Store:</strong> capture deadlocks, timeouts, and plan regressions; baseline known-good plans; surface p95 durations.</li>

            <li><strong>Backup/DR probes:</strong> record backup/restore durations and last verified restore; alert on RPO/RTO breaches.</li>
            <li><strong>ETL/job observability:</strong> per-step durations, retries, and data-quality checks (rowcount reconciliations, hash totals) for SSIS and SQL Server Agent jobs.</li>
            <li><strong>Alerts &amp; dashboards:</strong> route severity errors, long-running queries, and blocking chains into monitoring for paging/visuals.</li>

        <li><strong>Release pipeline</strong> — SSDT/DACPAC with versioned artifacts; schema-drift detection and fail gates; pre/post-deploy scripts idempotent and reversible; CI build 
          validates compile + drift; CD requires pre-prod gates (smoke, data-safe migration checks, plan/regression checks vs Query Store baseline); controlled change windows + rollback plan; 
          permissions and jobs (Agent/ADF) deployed as code alongside schema.</li>
        <li><strong>ETL reliability</strong> — Orchestrated, restartable jobs (SSIS checkpoints, idempotent loads); source-to-target DQ checks (rowcounts, hashes, null/PK/FK conformance); 
          watermarks/incrementals for large sets; late-arriving dimension handling and SCD policy; error quarantine with retries/backoff; resource governance (max concurrency, I/O windows) and 
          clear SLAs/SLIs for timeliness and freshness.</li>
        <li><strong>Capacity &amp; cost</strong> — Forecast storage/IO growth from baselines; right-size compute/memory (core counts, MAXDOP/CTFP, tempdb layout); tiering/retention (hot/warm/cold, 
          compression/columnstore, archive); backup/restore performance tested (throughput targets); cloud levers (vCore/DTU, reserved instances/auto-pause), cost dashboards with monthly variance 
          and tags/owners.</li>
        <li><strong>Incidents</strong> — Clear sev levels and on-call rota; first-five-minutes triage playbook (Is it down? scope, blast radius, rollback?); comms cadence templates; MTTA/MTTR tracked; 
          blameless postmortems with action items + owners + due dates; known-error DB and preventive fixes fed back into standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Standards &amp; practices</strong> — T-SQL style guide, naming and index conventions, approved patterns (retry, pagination, error handling); PR checklist (perf, concurrency, security, 
          deployability); “what good looks like” examples; lunch-and-learns, pair tuning, and lightweight guilds to propagate patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance &amp; governance</strong> — Data classification/labeling (PII/PHI/PCI), least-privilege + SoD; encryption at rest/in transit, key lifecycle management; audit trails 
          immutable/centralized with retention; periodic access recertification; change control (SOX) and HIPAA/PCI controls mapped to concrete checks; vendor/BAA where applicable.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation & knowledge transfer</strong> — Living runbooks (start/stop, failover, restore, release), topology/DR diagrams, env inventory; “Day-1/Day-2” ops checklists; build stamps 
          and script IDs; onboarding guides and handoffs; self-serve dashboards (p95, errors, capacity) linked from the docs to reduce tribal knowledge.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="note">Automation reduces toil so I can widen scope and raise quality—same workload, fewer surprises.</p>

            <h4 class="font-semibold">90‑minute Outage Rescues</h4>
            <p>At Grand Canyon University, I resolved a severe performance incident in under 90 minutes that had originally been allotted two weeks for triage. I quickly isolated the bottleneck, applied corrective measures, and stabilized the system. With the crisis resolved, I used the remaining time to design and implement a data-growth forecasting utility that gave the university greater visibility into long-term capacity planning.</p>
            <p>During a production outage at FlipSwitch, application performance collapsed after a key index was accidentally dropped. Because I had proactive monitoring in place—tracking disk queue length—I was alerted immediately before the full collapse began. I quickly diagnosed the missing index, scripted its recreation, and restored stability in under 90 minutes. The incident reinforced the value of proactive monitoring of performance metrics and resources, which enable rapid response and safeguard business continuity.</p>

          <article>
            <h4 class="font-semibold">Director who still ships</h4>
            <p>Led at OnePoint Patient Care for 5+ years while staying hands-on: built and maintained HL7 integrations end-to-end, tuned high-volume OLTP workloads, and delivered reliable releases under real-world pressure. I owned the data tier while running a small, high-performing team—prioritizing a tight backlog, code reviews, and on-call readiness. When incidents surfaced, I led the response and then hardened the system (monitoring, automated tests, and runbooks) to prevent recurrence. Leadership meant clearing roadblocks and setting standards, not stepping away from the keyboard.</p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <h4 class="font-semibold">Automation mindset</h4>
            <p>I build tools that take noisy, fragile routines and make them quiet and predictable. My utilities handle adaptive index maintenance, statistics refresh, CHECKDB scheduling with alerts, deadlock/blocked-session capture, job-health monitoring, and restore verification—idempotent by design with clear logs and guardrails. My current project, SQLAgent007, extends this approach across SQL Server, Azure SQL, and PostgreSQL with pluggable collectors, JSON-based configs, dry-run/safe modes, and opinionated defaults for production safety.</p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <h4 class="font-semibold">Production pragmatist</h4>
            <p>Bias for observability, repeatability, and low-drama ops: baseline before changes, deploy with rollback plans, and prefer small, reversible steps over risky “big bang” moves. I instrument with Query Store/DMVs/Extended Events, track waits and key counters, and keep runbooks current so on-call is calm, not chaotic. I’ll say “no” to shortcuts that jeopardize uptime—think cavalier NOLOCK usage, unbounded long-running scripts, or schema changes without a cutover plan—and I pair every DR claim with routine test restores and periodic failover drills.</p>
