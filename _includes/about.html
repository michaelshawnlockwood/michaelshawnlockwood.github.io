            My foundation in SQL Server and T-SQL development spans two decades. I specialize in performance, scalability, and 
            automation engineering across the full data lifecycle. I design and build complete data pipelines—from raw sources such 
            as Parquet, CSV, and PSV—through database design, development, and optimization now in Databricks, SQL Server, and 
            PostgreSQL, all the way to analytics and visualization in Power BI and D3.js. My work spans on-prem. and cloud-aligned 
            environments, including Azure and Databricks, where I also experiment locally with Azurite and MinIO to emulate real-world 
            cloud architectures for Delta Lake and object-storage integration. Though I can build APIs and UX layers, my strongest 
            impact is in the data tier, where design and performance converge.  
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m a highly motivated and naturally curious professional who takes pride in understanding how every layer of data architecture 
            fits together. Whether examining execution plans, tightening indexes, or refining data flows, I approach every challenge with a 
            performance-first, automation-second mindset. I value precision, reliability, and transparency—traits that have defined my 
            success across healthcare, finance, and hospitality systems for more than two decades.  
          </p>
          <p>
            I began with Microsoft Access while in college nearly 30 years ago. Naturally, I migrated to SQL Server using Microsoft’s Data 
            Transformation Services (DTS) and earned my MCDBA certification in 2006. SQL Server, T-SQL, and SSIS form the foundation of 
            my career. I also hold a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration from DeVry University.

            <p>
              I have been a database developer my entire adult life. I began with Microsoft Access while in college. Naturally, I 
              migrated to SQL Server using Microsoft's Data Transformation Services (DTS), earning my MCDBA certification in 2006. SQL Server, SSIS, and T-SQL have been my foundation 
              for more than 2 decades.
            </p>
            <p>
              From a clean slate, I can design and build a fully functional, secure, and well-formed database; populate it from raw data or migration sources; 
              validate it; and make it accessible to APIs and UX layers—which I can also develop, though my core strength is in the data tier. I’ve been writing 
              T-SQL for over two decades, working with SSIS for about 15 years, and I’m now expanding my experience in Airflow and Databricks for orchestration 
              and modern data engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
              I consider myself a data architect, database developer, DBA, and T-SQL practitioner on SQL Server—consistently focusing on performance, scalability, 
              automation, and high-availability solutions. For the past 15 years I've served as a Director, Senior DBA and Database Developer. I hold a Bachelor’s 
              degree in Business Administration from DeVry University. Why am I unemployed?
            </p>
            <p>
              Once Walmart Health's acquisition of MeMD finalized in June 2021, I took the opportunity to reset and invest time in furthering my education 
              and improving upon my skills through self-directed project work. One outcome is a multi-billion row public data engineering pipeline focused on 
              large-scale data ingestion, validation, and analytics across SQL Server, PostgreSQL and Databricks, separately for a number of reasons. I use 
              Python and PowerShell for converting and merging Parquet into PSV (and back), then bulk import into relational tables—extensions make this step 
              unnecessary because of Parquet adoption, but it's good to know. I use GitHub and VS Code for version control and development workflow. I use Airflow 
              to orchestrate repeatable pipelines, while Databricks supports heavy lifting, and it's slick. I document and publish my work and progress in my GitHub Pages.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've worked in slow, moderate, and fast-paced environments for many years, mostly in healthcare and transaction-heavy industries as a Senior DBA. 
              I'm a firm believer in mastering core platforms and technologies rather than a generalist. Still, I’ve taken time to learn and experiment with a 
              variety of tech.—PostgreSQL, Python, PowerShell, JavaScript, Power BI, D3.js, Hyper-V, VirtualBox, Docker, ASP.NET Core, Identity Server, Node.js, 
              Angular, CSS/Sass, and even MongoDB. <em>This is more than a laundry list of tech.</em> These explorations help me stay 
              adaptable and give me perspective, many of which I use in my recurring development and deployment cycles as part of my professional roadmap.

          <p>Here’s what the graphic shows: it maps my career (1997–present) as time-varying focus across four hats—Dev, 
            DBA, ETL, and Business-data Analysis. The heights are relative intensity per year, not percentages, so more 
            than one role can be high at once. Because every DBA stint also included hands-on development, the DBA band 
            lives within the broader Dev through-line, while ETL appears as intermittent spikes and then drops to zero 
            after 2021. A thin Analysis band runs across the bottom to reflect continuous—but varying—business-data work 
            (separate from DB administration, performance tuning, and development). The dashed segment after 2021 marks 
            independent project work that keeps Dev and Analysis active while DBA/ETL duties pause.</p>

      <h3 class="section-subtitle">What I’m Looking For</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          I’m seeking not only the right role but also the right environment—one where leadership provides 
          clear guardrails while encouraging innovation, where policies are practical and supportive, 
          and where ideas from any level can make their way to the table. In that kind of culture, I contribute 
          best: combining 20+ years of SQL Server experience with a bias for performance, automation, and verifiable, reliable results.</p>
        <p>
          I’m targeting Senior Database Developer, DBA, or Database Engineer roles that require many years of SQL Server 
          experience and exposure to a wide variety of data and workloads. My background includes query tuning, indexing strategy, 
          performance analysis, and HA/DR (FCIs, Always On Availability Groups, replication, and log shipping). T-SQL is my second language.
          I favor standardized change control and observability&mdash;tested backups, rehearsed restores, explicit RPO/RTO. SSIS is a core 
          tool; I’ve built enterprise-class ETL pipelines with it. I support DACPAC-based deployments using Visual Studio (SSDT). 
          I design and develop application-ready result sets&mdash;procedures, functions, views, window functions, etc.&mdash;with proper error 
          handing (TRY...CATCH). When appropriate, I steer towards automating and instrumenting the platform.</p>
        <p>I’m evolving with the industry&mdash;engaging with Azure SQL, SQL Server on Azure VMs, Airflow, Databricks, and AWS; plus Power BI for analytics and visualization. I’ve added PostgreSQL to my list 
          of platforms and am expanding my skill set to include Airflow and Databricks. My working sandbox is practical and current: VS Code; GitHub; Hyper-V, Oracle VirtualBox, and Docker for disposable 
          labs; WSFC and SQL Server FCI; Linux VMs (openSUSE Leap/Debian) for PostgreSQL and related tooling; Python, PowerShell, and Bash for scripting and automation; plus selective .NET/Identity Server 
          and REST APIs (Postman). I also use front-end tooling (C#, .NET, Angular, React, D3.js, Sass, SVG) for architecting full stacks, as well as to instrument, diagnose, test, and present&mdash;and, 
          most importantly, to understand. The <em>critical path</em> is straightforward: ship fast, safe, effective, and measurable changes to production databases. Ultimately, the broader 
          toolbelt is how I deliver, but my core work lives in the data tier.</p>

            <h4 class="font-semibold">90‑minute Outage Rescues</h4>
            <p>At Grand Canyon University, I resolved a severe performance incident in under 90 minutes that had originally been allotted two weeks for triage. I quickly isolated the bottleneck, applied corrective measures, and stabilized the system. With the crisis resolved, I used the remaining time to design and implement a data-growth forecasting utility that gave the university greater visibility into long-term capacity planning.</p>
            <p>During a production outage at FlipSwitch, application performance collapsed after a key index was accidentally dropped. Because I had proactive monitoring in place—tracking disk queue length—I was alerted immediately before the full collapse began. I quickly diagnosed the missing index, scripted its recreation, and restored stability in under 90 minutes. The incident reinforced the value of proactive monitoring of performance metrics and resources, which enable rapid response and safeguard business continuity.</p>

          <article>
            <h4 class="font-semibold">Director who still ships</h4>
            <p>Led at OnePoint Patient Care for 5+ years while staying hands-on: built and maintained HL7 integrations end-to-end, tuned high-volume OLTP workloads, and delivered reliable releases under real-world pressure. I owned the data tier while running a small, high-performing team—prioritizing a tight backlog, code reviews, and on-call readiness. When incidents surfaced, I led the response and then hardened the system (monitoring, automated tests, and runbooks) to prevent recurrence. Leadership meant clearing roadblocks and setting standards, not stepping away from the keyboard.</p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <h4 class="font-semibold">Automation mindset</h4>
            <p>I build tools that take noisy, fragile routines and make them quiet and predictable. My utilities handle adaptive index maintenance, statistics refresh, CHECKDB scheduling with alerts, deadlock/blocked-session capture, job-health monitoring, and restore verification—idempotent by design with clear logs and guardrails. My current project, SQLAgent007, extends this approach across SQL Server, Azure SQL, and PostgreSQL with pluggable collectors, JSON-based configs, dry-run/safe modes, and opinionated defaults for production safety.</p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <h4 class="font-semibold">Production pragmatist</h4>
            <p>Bias for observability, repeatability, and low-drama ops: baseline before changes, deploy with rollback plans, and prefer small, reversible steps over risky “big bang” moves. I instrument with Query Store/DMVs/Extended Events, track waits and key counters, and keep runbooks current so on-call is calm, not chaotic. I’ll say “no” to shortcuts that jeopardize uptime—think cavalier NOLOCK usage, unbounded long-running scripts, or schema changes without a cutover plan—and I pair every DR claim with routine test restores and periodic failover drills.</p>
