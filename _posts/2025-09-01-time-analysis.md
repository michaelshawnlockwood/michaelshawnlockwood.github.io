# Job Titles Flatten Careers

Job titles flatten careers. They collapse years of context into a single label and reduce the richness of lived work into keywords. Those keywords absolutely matter—we should **bold** them on our résumés so the skills are evident and not overlooked.

But that flattening is a real problem for job seekers. Both AI tools and human screeners scan résumés for keywords that hold some truth, yet they often miss the real story.

A résumé is a list. A career is a professional life—upwards of 2,000 hours every year—not including the time invested in keeping up with technology and industry trends. A meaningful career timeline shows not just what we know, but how we apply it to create solutions, solve business problems, and provide the technological foundation that enables companies to grow and thrive.

# Dark Matter

The invisible hours are never captured on a résumé. Technology professionals spend enormous time **keeping up with trends, releases, and shifting platforms**. Reading ~1,000-page certification guides, studying execution plans after hours, building lab environments, replaying migrations, or testing new features—these are all investments outside the 40-hour work week. Over the course of a career, this “dark matter” adds up to thousands of hours of learning. It’s the unseen gravity that shapes expertise, ensuring we’re not just repeating yesterday’s patterns but preparing solutions for tomorrow’s problems.

# Time and Focus Tell the Truth

Careers don’t happen in neat, non-overlapping boxes. Roles rise and fall in intensity. Some stay constant in the background, others spike with incidents, migrations, or projects.

This is also why keyword scanning—whether by AI or human—is so incomplete. It forces us to bold every noun that’s ever crossed our keyboard, as if each one deserves equal weight. Should I boldface *PuTTY* on my résumé just because I used it to execute SFTP? Of course not. I’m not fluent in it; I simply needed a tool to solve a problem.

The same is true for programming languages. Many of us in data and application roles aren’t “C# developers” or “Python developers” by title—we understand how languages work, that they compile or interpret, and we draw from them pragmatically to build pipelines, automate processes, or integrate systems. That doesn’t make each one a career-defining headline.

A timeline solves this problem. It shows **where the real intensity lived**. Dev is my throughline—always present. DBA work spikes during incidents and migrations. ETL comes in waves. Analysis runs in the background. Time and focus together tell the truth.

# Titles Overlap — Reality Is Messier

Honestly, having held the title *Senior DBA*, I can tell you: unless you’re in a very large enterprise (Choice Hotels comes to mind), it’s not really a full-time job once the environment is stable. When you’ve automated the vast majority of administrative duties, the work changes character. At Choice, for example, our database team of seven had a nightly rotation. Byron and I ended that rotation by building out a project that stored every step of the process in code, with documentation, well-written T-SQL, and execution plan analysis to keep it performant.

Once it was automated, it was a cakewalk. Operate the app, monitor, respond. And that app? It was *“appsolutely”* complete—no bugs, because we wrote and tested it end-to-end. Applications without bugs *are* possible.

The truth is, DBAs must also be developers. Writing a standards document at Choice was a perfect example: it defined how AppDevs had to structure SPs and UDFs so that we, as DBAs, could step in and fix performance issues when needed. Query tuning isn’t optional—you look at every execution plan, check indexes (present, correct, non-overlapping, with INCLUDES where needed), and make adjustments.

Automation was always my mindset. At Mellon Financial, I modeled tenants’ financial data profiles in DTS for re-use, and suddenly what looked like “endless work” became simple. At Choice, we built AIMS, with thresholds, notifications, and reporting. DefCon levels made it fun. Observability came through SSRS at the time, and today we’d push it further into Power BI.

The point: **titles overlap**. DBA work includes development. Developer work includes database design. Director-level work at OnePoint Patient Care included hands-on coding—beginning with the `CREATE DATABASE` statement—along with infrastructure decisions and leading a top-performing development team. 

> **The best results happen when those walls blur.**

That’s also why I’ve always admired the title *Data Architect*. It captures the reality that careers aren’t narrow lanes—they’re about designing, building, and sustaining solutions end to end.

# The Chart & Rules

![Roles Over Time Area Chart](/assets/images/time-analysis-area-chart.svg)

*Alt text: Dev continuous; DBA ends 2021; ETL intermittent; analysis thin band; dashed Dev 2021–2025.*

📊 **Clarity note:** The chart uses *independent intensity bands*—each role’s height is its own “how much focus” scale. Bands can overlap and don’t need to add to 1.0. Forcing them to stack to 100% would imply trade-offs that don’t exist (Dev can stay high while DBA spikes).

# Signals and Evidence

What makes this kind of representation honest (and auditable)?

- 📅 Dates & titles (normalized)  
- 🛠️ Artifacts: code repos, SSIS projects, scripts, runbooks, dashboards, tickets  
- 🚨 Signals of intensity: on-call weeks, incidents, migrations, releases  
- 🔑 Tech nouns & verbs that leave evidence (“index tuning,” “AlwaysOn,” “SSIS error handling”)

# Why This Matters for Hiring

Whether scanned by AI or skimmed by a human, résumés too often flatten into keyword bingo. But the real signal comes from **time, focus, and outcomes**.

For recruiters and hiring managers: ask candidates for evidence per year (artifacts, outcomes, migrations). For developers and DBAs: keep your evidence—repos, scripts, reports—so you can show intensity, not just titles. That’s how you see the true arc of a career.

# Closing Thoughts

Careers are not flat lists. They are lived timelines of focus, intensity, and problem-solving. Job titles flatten, but **time and focus tells truth**.

How about you?  
- For DBAs and developers: how does your intensity shift over time?  
- For recruiters and managers: what would you want to see beyond keywords?
