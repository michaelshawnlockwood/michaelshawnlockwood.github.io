Introduction
{: .md-h1-tt-intro}

<i class="fa-solid fa-clock-rotate-left"></i> The Concept of Time Travel
{: .md-h1 .intro .intro-content .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

In Delta Lake, Time Travel means you can read a table as it existed at any earlier point, without restoring backups or duplicating datasets. It‚Äôs enabled by Delta‚Äôs ACID transaction log (the _delta_log folder next to my Parquet files), which records every commit as an immutable, ordered sequence.
{: .intro .intro-content .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

Time Travel with Delta-RS: Local Experiments with MinIO, Azurite, and Databricks  
{: .md-h2 .intro .intro-content .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

- Context on Delta Lake and why ‚ÄúTime Travel‚Äù matters.  
- Mention my focus on local experimentation using **MinIO (HTTPS)** and **Azurite (HTTPS)** ‚Äî avoiding reliance on cloud-hosted services&mdash;_to avoid unnecessary costs associated with cloud compute for most developement and experimentation work._  
- Note that this work complements my earlier projects on Parquet ingestion, Delta-RS integration, and Azure emulation.  
{: .indent-md .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}
{% endcapture %}

{% include section.html class="bg-photo-tt" content=intro_md %}

__Versioned Parquet snapshots__  
Each commit produces a new table version (v0, v1, v2, ‚Ä¶). A version is just a logical snapshot composed of the Parquet files that were added or removed in that commit. Delta uses small JSON (and periodic checkpoint) files to describe which data files are active for each version.  
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

__ACID guarantees__  
The transaction log enforces atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. Readers see a consistent snapshot (no partial writes), writers don‚Äôt corrupt the table if they fail midway, and concurrent operations serialize into clean versions.  
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

__Schema enforcement & evolution__  
The log also captures schema information. Delta can enforce the expected schema and, when configured, evolve it (e.g., add a column) in a controlled, versioned way. Time Travel lets you query before or after such changes.  
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

__Reproducibility__  
Because every version is addressable (by version number or timestamp), you can rerun analyses exactly as they were, audit historical states, compare results across points in time, and debug upstream changes without rolling back data.  
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

__Retention-aware__  
Time Travel relies on the presence of historical log entries and data files. If you VACUUM aggressively or shorten log retention, very old versions may no longer be queryable. In other words: retention policies define how far back you can travel.  
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

__Net effect__  
Delta‚Äôs Time Travel turns my Parquet dataset into a transactional, versioned table where historical reads are first-class‚Äîfast, reliable, and independent of backup/restore workflows.  
{: .fancy .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

Contrast with traditional database recovery or restore scenarios in SQL Server.  
{: .md-h2i .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

üëÄ Highlight its practical uses: debugging, auditability, reproducible analytics, and schema evolution.
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

_Setting the Stage_  
{: .md-h1 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

- Describe my lab environment:  
{: .md-h2 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

  - MinIO bucket (`nyctaxi-pipeline`) over HTTPS for AWS S3 Blob Storage emulation
  - Azurite bucket (`nyctaxi`) over HTTPS for Azure Blob Storage emulation  
  - Databricks SQL (DBX SQL) for validation of versioned reads  
{: .indent-lg .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

- Mention the dataset (NYC Taxi, reduced Parquet samples) and Delta folder structure (`data_in`, `data_out`, `delta`, `snapshots`).  
{: .indent-md .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

Delta-RS and Local Connectivity  
{: .md-h2 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

- Overview of Delta-RS (Rust implementation of Delta Lake) and why it‚Äôs ideal for lightweight, cross-platform experimentation.  
- Discuss connection differences:  
{: .indent-md .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

  - `https://127.0.0.1:10000/...` for Azurite  
  - `https://127.0.0.1:9000/...` for MinIO  
{: .indent-lg .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

- Mention challenges with Azurite HTTPS (URL rewriting, emulator redirection) and why MinIO proved stable.  
{: .indent-md .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

üî¨ Performing Time Travel  
{: .md-h2 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

- Step-by-step summary of what the Time Travel operation does:  
{: .indent-md .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

  1. Read a Delta table at its latest version.  
  2. Retrieve table history to list all commits.  
  3. Query a prior version using `version=n` or a timestamp.  
{: .indent-lg .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

- Example outputs or command patterns (placeholder text for when you import screenshots/code).  
- Highlight that Delta-RS enforces version consistency even without Spark or JVM dependencies.  
{: .indent-md .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

Comparing Environments  
{: .md-h2 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

- Observations comparing behavior between:
{: .indent-md .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

  - Delta-RS over Azurite (HTTP)  
  - Delta-RS over MinIO (HTTPS)  
  - Databricks SQL dashboard  
{: .indent-lg .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

- Discuss any performance or compatibility nuances.  
- Mention how Databricks confirms Delta-RS read consistency.  
{: .indent-md .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

‚ö° Using Azure CLI  
{: .md-h2 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

> Although Azurite is a local emulator, its strength lies in **behaving like real Azure Storage**.  
> By using the **Azure CLI**, we can interact with the emulator through the same commands used against production Azure Blob > services.  
> This parity makes every operation ‚Äî from container creation to blob enumeration ‚Äî feel authentic and transferable.  
> Azure CLI isn‚Äôt just convenient; it reinforces confidence that our local workflows will behave identically in the cloud.

{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

This is the kind of real-world request that comes in from Finance, Operations, or Marketing.  
The timeline is narrow, but the expectation is absolute clarity:
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

- Time window: **2025-03-12 ‚Üí 2025-05-15**  
- Output: a single Parquet export written directly to MinIO via HTTPS  
- Result: **53,524 rows**, cleanly scoped to the requested window  
{: .indent-md .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

This Parquet file is the one-click data source for Power BI:
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

**A** and **B** from quick DAX measures on `fare_amount`, `tip_amount`, and `total_amount`  
**C** from a simple group-by on `payment_type`  
**D** using the `PUlocationID` dimension lookup  
**E** by counting distinct `VendorID` values  
{: .indent-md .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

Databricks will join later in the workflow ‚Äî it‚Äôs still a ‚Äúthin‚Äù layer now, but will soon host the same Delta tables for shared compute and reproducible dashboards.

üß† Pseudocode ‚Äî Delta Lake Time Travel (Databricks Community Edition)  
{: .md-h3 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

1. **Create a small Delta table** in my user catalog (DBFS-backed) and note its path.  
2. **Make 2‚Äì3 writes** (insert, update, delete) to generate multiple versions.  
3. **Inspect history** with `DESCRIBE HISTORY` to confirm version numbers.  
4. **Query past snapshots** using `VERSION AS OF <n>` and `TIMESTAMP AS OF '<ts>'`.  
5. *(Optional)* Demonstrate the **`@` syntax** (`table@v123` or `table@yyyyMMddHHmmssSSS`) as an alternative.  
6. **Avoid running `VACUUM`** for now ‚Äî old Parquet files are required for Time Travel to function.

<img src="/assets/images/tiles/DBX.png" alt="Databricks" class="tile-sm" /> Time Travel in Databricks (DBX)  
{: .md-h2 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

‚öôÔ∏è What Works in Databricks Community Edition (DBX CE)  
{: .md-h3 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

‚úÖ **Delta Time Travel** by **version** and **timestamp** works natively in CE using both SQL and Spark APIs.  
‚úÖ **`DESCRIBE HISTORY`** lists operations, timestamps, and version numbers for any Delta table.  
‚úÖ **`@version` / `@timestamp` syntax** is supported as a shortcut alternative to `VERSION AS OF` and `TIMESTAMP AS OF`.  
{: .indent-md1 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

‚ö†Ô∏è **Use DBFS-backed managed tables.** External object stores (S3, ADLS, MinIO, Azurite) and Unity Catalog features aren‚Äôt available in CE.  
{: .indent-md1 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

üí° **Everything happens locally** inside the user workspace; still perfect for demonstrating Delta‚Äôs ACID log and snapshot isolation behavior.
{: .indent-md1 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

---

‚è±Ô∏è Time Travel by Timestamp (DBX CE)
{: ,md-h2 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

**How:** Copy a timestamp from `DESCRIBE HISTORY` and query the table *as of that moment*.
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

First, I'll create a small table and populate it with a few rows.
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

```sql
CREATE TABLE tt_demo (id INT, note STRING)
USING DELTA;

-- Insert an initial version
INSERT INTO tt_demo VALUES (1, 'v1 insert'), (2, 'v1 insert'), (3, 'v1 update'), (4, 'v1 delete');

-- Verify data
SELECT * FROM tt_demo;
```
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

![Databricks tt_demo table](/assets/images/screenshots/databricks-tt-demo-step-1.JPG)
{: .aos .aos-right .screenshot-xsm}

Now, execute `DESCRIBE HISTORY tt_demo;`
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

```sql
DESCRIBE HISTORY tt_demo;
```
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

üßæ Understanding `DESCRIBE HISTORY` in Delta Lake
{: .md-h2 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

The `DESCRIBE HISTORY` command is Delta Lake‚Äôs built-in window into your table‚Äôs **transaction log**.  
When executed, it reads the metadata stored in the hidden `_delta_log` folder and returns a complete **audit trail** of all commits ‚Äî one row per table version.
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

This audit view is both a **technical ledger** (used by Time Travel) and a **compliance record** (used for governance and traceability).
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

![Databricks tt_demo DESCRIBE HISTORY](/assets/images/screenshots/databricks-tt-demo-step-1-describe.JPG)
{: .aos .aos-right .screenshot-lg }

üß© What Each Column Means  
{: .md-h3 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

| Column | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **version** | Sequential number identifying the commit (starting at 0). Each write, update, or delete increments this version. |
| **timestamp** | UTC timestamp when the operation was committed to the transaction log. |
| **userId / userName** | The identity of the user who performed the operation (automatically captured in Databricks). |
| **operation** | The action performed ‚Äî e.g., `CREATE TABLE`, `WRITE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `MERGE`. |
| **operationParameters** | JSON-formatted details describing the operation, such as filters, partition columns, or write mode. |
| **readVersion** | The table version that the writer read before making this commit. |
| **isolationLevel** | Confirms transactional integrity (commonly `WriteSerializable` for Delta ACID compliance). |
| **operationMetrics** | Counts of files or rows affected (inserted, updated, deleted). |
| **engineInfo** | Identifies the Databricks Runtime or Delta engine version that executed the operation. |
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

‚ùó Why It Matters
{: .md-h3 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

- **Time Travel Reference** ‚Äî It provides the version numbers and timestamps you use in `VERSION AS OF` and `TIMESTAMP AS OF` queries.  
- **Lineage & Auditing** ‚Äî Acts as a detailed change log showing who did what, when, and how.  
- **Compliance Evidence** ‚Äî Vital for regulated pipelines (e.g., those handling PII or PHI) where reproducibility and traceability are required.  
- **Operational Debugging** ‚Äî Quickly spot unexpected writes, failed jobs, or schema changes.
{: .indent-md .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

‚ú® **Summary**  
`DESCRIBE HISTORY` is the **table of contents for Delta‚Äôs transaction log** ‚Äî the foundation of **Time Travel**, **data lineage**, and **auditability** in every Delta table.
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

Next, UPDATE one row to create version 2
```sql
UPDATE tt_demo SET note = 'v2 update' WHERE id = 3;
```
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

And, DELETE one row to create version 3
```sql
DELETE FROM tt_demo WHERE id = 4;
```
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

Now, rerun `DESCRIBE HISTORY`
```sql
DESCRIBE HISTORY tt_demo;
```
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

üìú Results ‚Äî Time Travel in Action
{: .md-h2}

| Version | Operation | Expected State | Verified |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **0** | `CREATE TABLE` | Table created, empty | ‚úÖ |
| **1** | `WRITE` (INSERT) | Rows (1‚Äì4) inserted | ‚úÖ |
| **2** | `UPDATE` | Row `id=3` ‚Üí `v2 update` | ‚úÖ |
| **3** | `DELETE` | Row `id=4` removed | ‚úÖ |

Snapshot Verification
{: .md-h3}

- **Current State (v3)** ‚Üí rows 1‚Äì3 (`v2 update` present, id 4 gone)  
- **As of Version 1** ‚Üí original four rows intact  
- **As of Version 2** ‚Üí same four rows, but `id 3` shows `v2 update`  
- **@ Syntax** ‚Üí identical results (`SELECT * FROM tt_demo@v1`)
{: .indent-md .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

‚úÖ **Conclusion:** Each Delta write produces an immutable versioned snapshot.  
`VERSION AS OF` and `TIMESTAMP AS OF` allow point-in-time reads without restores or backups ‚Äî proving Delta‚Äôs ACID transaction log guarantees.

ü•â Bronze ‚Äî Raw & Ingested  
{: .md-h3 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

- **Purpose:** Capture data *exactly as received* from source systems ‚Äî the immutable foundation for all downstream processing.  
- **Format:** Often unstructured or semi-structured (CSV, JSON, logs, EHR extracts, HL7 messages, Parquet dumps).  
- **Characteristics:**  
{: .indent-md .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

  - No transformations, no filtering ‚Äî fidelity to source is paramount.  
  - **PII and PHI are often present in full form**, making this layer highly sensitive.  
  - Access should be **restricted, audited, and short-lived** where possible.  
  - Schema may be inferred or missing; quality checks begin *after* landing.  
{: .indent-lg .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

- **Example:** Raw HL7 or FHIR data feeds containing patient identifiers, medication details, or encounter notes stored as Delta for traceability.  
{: .indent-md .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

‚ö†Ô∏è **Compliance Caution:**  
The **Bronze layer is never safe for broad access**.  
Organizations typically enforce isolation at this stage ‚Äî dedicated storage accounts, ACLs, encryption at rest (TDE or SSE), and network-level restrictions ‚Äî ensuring only controlled ETL processes can read or transform data into the **Silver** layer where de-identification begins.

## üîí What ‚ÄúDe-Identification‚Äù Means (PII/PHI)
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

**Goal:** Reduce the chance a person can be identified from the data while preserving utility for analytics.
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

Two regulatory paths (HIPAA)  
{: .md-h3 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

- **Safe Harbor:** Remove the prescribed set of direct identifiers (the ‚Äú18 identifiers,‚Äù e.g., name, full address, phone, email, SSN, MRN, full-precision dates, etc.).
- **Expert Determination:** A qualified expert certifies that re-identification risk is very small given context and controls.
{: .indent-md .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

Common techniques (choose per use case)  
{: .md-h3 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

| Technique | What it does | Reversible? | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Masking**         | Obscure parts (e.g., `555-***-****`)          | No          | Quick, lightweight; still sensitive if many fields remain. |
| **Tokenization**    | Replace with random tokens (`PAT_9F3A‚Ä¶`)      | Yes*        | Requires secure vault/map; analytics on joins via tokens. |
| **Hashing (+salt)** | Deterministic pseudonyms from identifiers     | Yes*        | Use strong hash + per-env salt; vulnerable without salt. |
| **Generalization**  | Reduce precision (e.g., age ‚Üí 10-year bins)   | No          | Key for k-anonymity; helps aggregate reporting. |
| **Suppression**     | Drop high-risk fields/rows entirely           | No          | Use for outliers/small groups. |
| **Date shifting**   | Shift dates consistently per subject          | Yes*        | Preserve intervals; keep shift secret and consistent. |
| **Aggregation**     | Summarize (counts, rates)                     | No          | Use for Gold KPIs to avoid small-cell disclosure. |
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

\*__Reversible by a holder of keys/salts/mappings ‚Üí **pseudonymization**, not full anonymization.__
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

Where it fits in Medallion
{: .md-h3 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

- **Bronze ‚Üí Silver:** De-identification begins here. Identify sensitive columns, apply masking/tokenization/generalization, remove free-text PHI, and enforce schema + access controls. Keep an **auditable mapping** of transformations.
- **Silver ‚Üí Gold:** Prefer aggregated, minimal datasets. Apply small-cell suppression (e.g., do not show counts < 10) and expose only what reports need.  
{: .indent-md .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

Gotchas (easy to miss)  
{: .md-h3 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

- **Free-text notes** often contain PHI‚Äîredact or drop.  
- **Dates & locations** can re-identify (e.g., rare events); generalize (month/quarter, 3-digit ZIP).  
- **Linkage attacks**: Even de-identified data can be re-identified when joined with external datasets; mitigate with governance, access limits, and aggregation.  
{: .indent-md .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

**Bottom line:** In my pipeline, *de-identification is a controlled, documented step at the Silver layer* that turns raw PHI/PII into safer, analysis-ready data‚Äîwhile preserving lineage back to Bronze if regulated audits require it.
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

ü•à Silver ‚Äî Cleaned & Structured  
{: .md-h3 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

- **Purpose:** Provide **trusted, queryable data** for analytics and integration.  
- **Format:** Fully structured with enforced schema and data types.  
- **Characteristics:**  
{: .indent-md .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

  - Deduped, validated, normalized, and enriched.  
  - **PII and PHI protections are applied here** ‚Äî identifiers masked, tokenized, or removed during transition from Bronze.  
  - Data quality, referential integrity, and business rules established.  
  - Serves as the **first broadly accessible layer** under governance controls. 
{: .indent-lg .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

- **Example:** Patient encounter data joined with provider and medication reference tables, exposing only de-identified or coded fields such as encounter date, diagnosis group, and billing category.  
{: .indent-md .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

---

üîí **Governance Continuity:**  
Bronze captures everything for lineage; Silver enforces what‚Äôs *appropriate* for consumption.  
This is the **compliance bridge** where raw sensitivity becomes managed data ‚Äî ensuring every downstream Gold dataset remains HIPAA-aligned and enterprise-safe.
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

---

ü•á Gold ‚Äî Aggregated & Business-Ready  
{: .md-h3 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

- **Purpose:** Deliver **insight-ready** datasets for consumption (BI, ML, APIs).  
- **Format:** Star/Snowflake models, curated views, or feature tables.  
- **Characteristics:**  
{: .indent-md .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

  - Aggregated, summarized, and optimized for performance.  
  - Tailored to specific use cases (finance, marketing, operations).  
  - Supports dashboards, KPIs, and machine learning pipelines.  
{: .indent-lg .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

- **Example:** Monthly revenue summaries, per-vendor performance metrics, or pre-joined datasets driving Power BI visuals.  
{: .indent-md .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

üí° *In short:*  
**Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold** represents the journey from **raw chaos to refined intelligence**, where structure, trust, and usability increase at every stage.
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

üîí **Compliance Note:**  
In healthcare and other regulated domains, *data classification and privacy enforcement* typically begin at the **Silver** layer.  
That‚Äôs where organizations enforce de-identification, apply data-access controls, and maintain audit logs before promoting data to **Gold**, ensuring all consumption layers remain compliant and safe.

Terminology ‚Äî Layer vs. Zone vs. Domain
{: .md-h2 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

| Term | Connotation | Common Usage |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| **Layer** | Logical stage of data refinement (Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold). | ‚úÖ *Standard in Databricks and Delta Lake documentation.* |
| **Zone** | Often used in cloud storage contexts (e.g., raw zone, curated zone). | üü° *Valid but more storage-oriented than logical.* |
| **Domain** | Refers to a *business domain* (Finance, HR, Patient Care). | ‚öôÔ∏è *Common in data mesh or microservice architectures.* |
| **Space** | Informal; sometimes used internally to describe work areas. | üîπ *Avoid in formal architecture language.* |
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

**In short:**  
> *Use ‚Äúlayer‚Äù when referring to Bronze, Silver, and Gold.  
> Use ‚Äúdomain‚Äù when referring to business subject areas.*

üïì Time Travel Across the Medallion Layers 
{: .md-h2 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

Delta‚Äôs **Time Travel** feature is layer-agnostic ‚Äî it functions anywhere Delta tables exist ‚Äî  
but its *intent and value* vary by stage of refinement:
{: .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

ü•â Bronze Layer ‚Äî **Forensics & Recovery**  
{: .md-h3 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

- Use TT to **replay or re-ingest** raw data exactly as it arrived.  
- Valuable for **incident response** or verifying source integrity.  
- Example: Compare raw HL7 messages from version 0 to version 5 after ETL code changes.  
{: .indent-md .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

ü•à Silver Layer ‚Äî **Audit & Validation**  
{: .md-h3 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

- TT becomes a **data-quality checkpoint**: confirm that cleansing, joins, and de-identification behaved as expected.  
- Enables **before/after comparisons** across schema-enforced snapshots.  
- Example: Inspect patient records prior to masking or deduplication.  
{: .indent-md .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

ü•á Gold Layer ‚Äî **Reproducibility & Traceability**  
{: .md-h3 .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

- TT supports **historical reporting** and reproducible analytics.  
- Analysts can regenerate a dashboard *as it appeared on a given date*.  
- Example: Query `gold.monthly_revenue VERSION AS OF 57` to match a published KPI report.  
{: .indent-md .fly-in .fly-in-delay-3}

---

üí° **Summary**  
Time Travel is the connective tissue between Medallion layers ‚Äî  
it preserves **lineage, reproducibility, and trust**, ensuring that every refinement step from Bronze ‚Üí Silver ‚Üí Gold can be explained, audited, and, if necessary, *rolled back in time.*
