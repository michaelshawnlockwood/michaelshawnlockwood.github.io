## SQL Server Naming Conventions

Naming conventions (also known as *identifier naming standards*) are essential technical rules for choosing consistent, meaningful names for database objects and fields. They improve readability, reduce errors, and enhance cross-team collaboration.

### Object Names (Tables, Views, Stored Procedures, Functions)

- Use **PascalCase** (UpperCamelCase) for all database object names.  
  - Examples: `YellowTripData`, `GenerateZoneSummary`, `uspCreateTaxiTables`.  
- Avoid underscores in object names—PascalCase is cleaner, easier to type, and aligns with many AppDev frameworks.

### Column Names and Parameters

- Use **camelCase** for all internal column names, stored procedure parameters, and variables.  
  - Examples: `pickupDate`, `zoneId`, `totalAmount`.  
- This follows common practices in application development and APIs, making integration seamless (especially for JSON serialization).

### API / JSON Output

- Return **camelCase** field names to clients to meet application and API consumer conventions.  

```sql
SELECT [zoneId] = [PULocationID],
    [tripCount] = COUNT(*)
FROM [dbo].[YellowTripData]
GROUP BY [PULocationID]
FOR JSON PATH, ROOT('zones');
```
