# Delta-RS Proof: Why Late Data Matters More Than You Think

When the dashboards look good, that’s usually where most projects stop.
But in a well-designed architecture, that’s not the end of the story — it’s where scrutiny by the business at the consumption layer begins.

How many times has someone asked, “Is this accurate?”
If the number changes — even slightly, especially when that change is statistically significant — the entire process comes into question.

The architecture is proven, and the data pipeline is solid. Early validation checks already confirmed structure and completeness through row counts and sampling.
The challenge now is managing what happens after ingestion — detecting late arrivals, reconciling anomalies, and documenting every corrective decision transparently.

That’s the data engineer’s responsibility. No excuses.
Delta-RS exists to make that responsibility measurable, repeatable, and auditable. We'll see.

My Power BI dashboard for NYC Taxi data looks solid — average monthly revenue, fare totals by payment type, vendor and payment type composition&mdash;clean visuals across six months of data. For the purpose of a PoC, I'm backing out Q2.  

Everything reconciles beautifully… until **April arrives**, bringing a statistically significant volume of **late data** that should have been included in **Q1**.

---

## Business Context: The Impact of Late-Arriving Data

The dataset represents about **2% of real-world NYC Taxi traffic**, roughly **$1.5M** in fare totals for the first quarter&mdash;sampled using Bernoulli sampling . . . more on this later. 
Scaled up, that’s equivalent to around **$75M+** in actual monthly revenue.  
Now imagine what happens when 0.5% of that revenue arrives late or needs correction:

| Example | Hypothetical Value | Business Impact |
|----------|--------------------|-----------------|
| True quarterly gross | $215 M | 100% baseline |
| Commission rate | 30% | $64.5 M in commissions |
| Data correction (0.5%) | $10.75 M | Direct financial exposure |
| Reconciliation lag | 1 month | Delayed trust + missed insights |

That small shift affects everyone — drivers, vendors, regulators, accountants, and executives.  
When your business is measured in **billions**, even a fraction of a percent matters.

## The Core Problem: Reporting Instability

Late-arriving rides mean revenue from January, February, or March may suddenly increase or decrease after the books were “closed.”  
Traditional pipelines can’t handle this gracefully:

- **Rebuild risk:** Re-running entire ETL chains to capture corrections.  
- **Dashboard drift:** KPIs shift after the fact — “Wait, why did March change?”  
- **Audit pain:** No version history or explanation trail.  

In other words, the data *looks right today*, but it’s not *trustworthy tomorrow*.

## The Solution: Delta-RS on MinIO

Enter **Delta-RS**, an open-source, Rust-based implementation of the Delta Lake format.  
It brings ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and time travel to our **S3-compatible MinIO bucket** — without adding external dependencies or complexity.

Here’s how I’ll prove it.

## The Proof Plan

Each small demo connects a **technical behavior** to a **business guarantee**:

| Step | Demo | Business Outcome |
|------|------|------------------|
| **1. Create v1 (Baseline)** | Write Jan–Mar to Delta | “This is the frozen Q1 report.” |
| **2. Append v2 (Late Arrivals)** | Append April + late Q1 rides | “We can accept corrections safely.” |
| **3. Schema Enforcement** | Attempt to append invalid data | “Bad data can’t enter the system.” |
| **4. Schema Evolution** | Add a new nullable column (`promo_code`) | “We evolve without breaking dashboards.” |
| **5. Time Travel** | Compare version 1 vs 2 in Power BI | “We can show what changed and when.” |
| **6. Audit View** | List commit history | “Every update is traceable — who, what, when.” |

---

## Why It Matters

> “With Delta-RS, we can tell the business **exactly what changed and why** when late data arrives — while keeping the live dashboard stable.  
> No guessing. No reloads. No broken reports.”

This is the difference between *reporting numbers* and *trusting numbers*.

Delta-RS gives us the foundation for both:
- **Data consistency** for engineering  
- **Version transparency** for governance  
- **Historical clarity** for finance

## What’s Next

In the next post, we’ll begin **Demo #1: Creating the Tiny Delta Table (v1)**  
We’ll write just 10 rows, capture the first `_delta_log` JSON file, and explain why that single transaction file is the key to making business data trustworthy — even when reality arrives late.

Stay tuned.
