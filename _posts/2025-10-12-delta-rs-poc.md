# Delta-RS Proof: Why Late Data Matters More Than You Think

When the dashboards look good, that‚Äôs usually where most projects stop.
But in a well-designed architecture, that‚Äôs not the end of the story ‚Äî it‚Äôs where scrutiny by the business at the consumption layer begins.

How many times has someone asked, ‚ÄúIs this accurate?‚Äù
If the number changes ‚Äî even slightly, especially when that change is statistically significant ‚Äî the entire process comes into question.

üß± The architecture is proven, and the data pipeline is solid. Early validation checks already confirmed structure and completeness through row counts and sampling.
The challenge now is managing what happens after ingestion ‚Äî detecting late arrivals, reconciling anomalies, and documenting every corrective decision transparently.

That‚Äôs the data engineer‚Äôs responsibility. No excuses.
Delta-RS exists to make that responsibility measurable, repeatable, and auditable. We'll see.

My Power BI dashboard for NYC Taxi data looks solid ‚Äî average monthly revenue, fare totals by payment type, vendor and payment type composition&mdash;clean visuals across six months of data. For the purpose of a PoC, I'm backing out Q2.  

Everything reconciles beautifully‚Ä¶ until **April arrives**, bringing a statistically significant volume of **late data** that should have been included in **Q1**.

---

## Business Context: The Impact of Late-Arriving Data

The dataset represents about **2% of real-world NYC Taxi traffic**, roughly **$1.5M** in fare totals for the first quarter&mdash;sampled using Bernoulli sampling . . . more on this later. 
Scaled up, that‚Äôs equivalent to around **$75M+** in actual monthly revenue.  
Now imagine what happens when 0.5% of that revenue arrives late or needs correction:

| Example | Hypothetical Value | Business Impact |
|----------|--------------------|-----------------|
| True quarterly gross | $215 M | 100% baseline |
| Commission rate | 30% | $64.5 M in commissions |
| Data correction (0.5%) | $10.75 M | Direct financial exposure |
| Reconciliation lag | 1 month | Delayed trust + missed insights |

That small shift affects everyone ‚Äî drivers, vendors, regulators, accountants, and executives.  
When your business is measured in **billions**, even a fraction of a percent matters.

---

## The Core Problem: Reporting Instability

Late-arriving rides mean revenue from January, February, or March may suddenly increase or decrease after the books were ‚Äúclosed.‚Äù  
Traditional pipelines can‚Äôt handle this gracefully:

- **Rebuild risk:** Re-running entire ETL chains to capture corrections.  
- **Dashboard drift:** KPIs shift after the fact ‚Äî ‚ÄúWait, why did March change?‚Äù  
- **Audit pain:** No version history or explanation trail.  

In other words, the data *looks right today*, but it‚Äôs not *trustworthy tomorrow*.

---

## The Solution: Delta-RS on MinIO

Enter **Delta-RS**, an open-source, Rust-based implementation of the Delta Lake format.  
It brings ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and time travel to our **S3-compatible MinIO bucket** ‚Äî without adding external dependencies or complexity.

üß© The stack:  
 - A microcosm of a cloud lakehouse:  
 - MinIO = S3/ADLS  
 - Delta-RS = Delta/Iceberg metadata engine  
 - PolyBase = SQL-to-lake connector
 - Power BI = semantic/BI layer

Here‚Äôs how I intend to prove it.

## The Proof Plan

Each small demo connects a **technical behavior** to a **business guarantee**:

| Step | Demo | Business Outcome |
|------|------|------------------|
| **1. Create v1 (Baseline)** | Write Jan‚ÄìMar to Delta | ‚ÄúThis is the frozen Q1 report.‚Äù |
| **2. Append v2 (Late Arrivals)** | Append April + late Q1 rides | ‚ÄúWe can accept corrections safely.‚Äù |
| **3. Schema Enforcement** | Attempt to append invalid data | ‚ÄúBad data can‚Äôt enter the system.‚Äù |
| **4. Schema Evolution** | Add a new nullable column (`promo_code`) | ‚ÄúWe evolve without breaking dashboards.‚Äù |
| **5. Time Travel** | Compare version 1 vs 2 in Power BI | ‚ÄúWe can show what changed and when.‚Äù |
| **6. Audit View** | List commit history | ‚ÄúEvery update is traceable ‚Äî who, what, when.‚Äù |

---

## Why It Matters

> ‚ÄúWith Delta-RS, we can tell the business **exactly what changed and why** when late data arrives ‚Äî while keeping the live dashboard stable.  
> No guessing. No reloads. No broken reports.‚Äù

This is the difference between *reporting numbers* and *trusting numbers*.

Delta-RS gives us the foundation for both:
- **Data consistency** for engineering  
- **Version transparency** for governance  
- **Historical clarity** for finance

## What‚Äôs Next

In the next post, we‚Äôll begin **Demo #1: Creating the Tiny Delta Table (v1)**  
We‚Äôll write just 10 rows, capture the first `_delta_log` JSON file, and explain why that single transaction file is the key to making business data trustworthy ‚Äî even when reality arrives late.

## Query the Snapshot  
 - Create External Tables for each month of the Quarter (Q1)

```sql
USE [NYCTaxi]
GO
SET ANSI_NULLS ON
GO
SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON
GO

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE [ext].[YellowTrips_Snapshot_2025_01]
(
	[VendorID] [int] NULL,
	[tpep_pickup_datetime] [bigint] NULL,
	[tpep_dropoff_datetime] [bigint] NULL,
	[passenger_count] [int] NULL,
	[trip_distance] [float] NULL,
	[RatecodeID] [int] NULL,
	[store_and_fwd_flag] [nvarchar](1) NULL,
	[PULocationID] [int] NULL,
	[DOLocationID] [int] NULL,
	[payment_type] [int] NULL,
	[fare_amount] [float] NULL,
	[extra] [float] NULL,
	[mta_tax] [float] NULL,
	[tip_amount] [float] NULL,
	[tolls_amount] [float] NULL,
	[improvement_surcharge] [float] NULL,
	[total_amount] [float] NULL,
	[congestion_surcharge] [float] NULL,
	[airport_fee] [float] NULL
)
WITH (
	DATA_SOURCE = [LocalS3],
	LOCATION = N'snapshots/yellowtrips/2025/q1/v1/year=2025/month=1',
	FILE_FORMAT = [ParquetFF],
	REJECT_TYPE = VALUE,
	REJECT_VALUE = 0)
GO
```

### Is It Customary to Create Monthly External Tables?

Yes ‚Äî this is a **standard, professional pattern** for working with Parquet files through PolyBase (or external tables in general).  
Here‚Äôs how _seasoned engineers_ think about it.

---

#### ‚úÖ Why ‚ÄúOne External Table per Partition‚Äù Is Common

- **Predictable pruning:**  
  PolyBase doesn‚Äôt automatically detect folder partitions (like `year=2025/month=1/`), so targeting each partition directly ensures 
  SQL Server scans only the files you intend.

- **Stable semantics:**  
  Each external table represents a fixed data slice. Quarterly or annual views (`UNION ALL`) are simple, transparent, and fast.  
  Power BI sees a consistent schema every time.

- **Versioning support:**  
  Snapshot-based paths (e.g., `/q1/v1/`) map cleanly to independent external tables.  
  Compare `v1` vs `v2` without conflicts or accidental overwrites.

---

[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#toc){:.back-to-top}
#### ‚öôÔ∏è Common Variations in the Wild

| Pattern | LOCATION Example | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------------------|------|------|
| **Per-Month Table** | `.../year=2025/month=1/` | Fine-grained control; best pruning; easy to replace individual months | More objects to manage |
| **Per-Quarter Table** | `.../q1/v1/` | Fewer objects; still partitioned | Slightly larger scans |
| **Per-Version Table** | `.../2025/q1/v1/` | Easy snapshot management | No per-month control |
| **Ad-hoc OPENROWSET** | Direct S3/HTTPS path | Great for testing | Not stable or reusable |

---

#### üí° When to Keep Your Current Approach

- You want **exact control** over each month‚Äôs snapshot.  
- You‚Äôre implementing **immutable Delta-RS versions** (Q1 v1, Q1 v2, etc.).  
- You value **transparent lineage** ‚Äî table name ‚Üî folder path.

The pattern makes sense in data-governed or reproducibility-focused environments (finance, healthcare, regulated analytics).  
It‚Äôs also ideal for a **Power BI dual-view** model ‚Äî ‚ÄúCurrent‚Äù vs ‚ÄúSnapshot.‚Äù

[‚¨Ü Back to Top](#toc){:.back-to-top}
#### üîß Best Practices

- Keep naming consistent:  
  `ext.YellowTrips_Snap_2025_01` ‚Ä¶ `_12`, `vw_YellowTrips_Snapshot_2025_Q1`.
- Reuse shared resources:  
  One `[LocalS3]` data source and one `[ParquetFF]` file format.
- Lock schemas in views:  
  `WITH SCHEMABINDING` for stable Power BI relationships.
- Optionally, automate:  
  Generate the 12 external tables and 4 quarterly views from a simple script template (e.g., looping through months).

---

**In short:** this approach is not only valid ‚Äî it‚Äôs what *seasoned professionals* use when precision, immutability, 
and verifiable lineage matter more than convenience.
