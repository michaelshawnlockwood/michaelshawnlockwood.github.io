# Milestones 
- Promoted **NODE1** to Domain Controller and confirmed DNS/AD DS health (`lab.local` zone).  
- Joined **NODE2** and **NODE3** to the domain with secure channel verification.  
- Established consistent **SMB shares** from the host:  
  - `\\MSL-Laptop\PowerShellScripts` ‚Üí T:  
  - `\\MSL-Laptop\nyctaxi` ‚Üí N:  
  - `\\MSL-Laptop\ISOs` ‚Üí I:  
- Created and presented **cluster-capable virtual drives** (SQLData, SQLLog, SQLBackup).  
- Validated **disk visibility** and ownership across nodes.  
- Ran and passed **WSFC validation tests**.  
- Built the **Windows Server Failover Cluster** with NODE2 and NODE3 as initial members.  

# Objectives
- Confirm domain/DNS health across all nodes.  
- Ensure cluster disks are online and visible.  
- Run WSFC validation.  
- Create a healthy Failover Cluster as the foundation for SQL Server.

# Notes
- **Nodes must remain online during cluster operations.** Even if another node owns the resources, paused nodes cannot participate in SQL FCI setup.

Nuance: A paused node is still a cluster member but won‚Äôt host roles; pausing is commonly used for maintenance with ‚Äúdrain roles.‚Äù For an Add Node FCI step, the target node should be online and able to access required resources; pausing can interfere with owning/bringing resources online during parts of setup. Safer wording: ‚ÄúKeep nodes online and not paused during FCI add/maintenance unless you‚Äôre deliberately draining roles for maintenance.‚Äù üü® 

- **Always rerun Test-Cluster after changes.** Adding nodes or disks without revalidating can surface issues later during SQL installation.  
- **Consistent drive letters and labels are critical.** SQL setup depends on predictable disk mapping; mismatches complicate placement of data, log, and backup files.  
- **Validate SMB share access via UNC paths.** Shares may appear mapped but silently break under DNS or domain hiccups; confirm visibility from every node.

# Steps
1. **Promote NODE1 to Domain Controller**  
   Installed AD DS + DNS, established `lab.local`, and confirmed zone health.  

2. **Validate DNS resolution**  
   Ensured `lab.local`, `SQLNODE1.lab.local`, and hostnames resolved cleanly across nodes.  

3. **Join NODE2 and NODE3 to domain**  
   Verified secure channel trust; corrected any DNS/GW issues blocking domain membership.  

4. **Map SMB shares from host**  
   Consistent drive letters across all nodes:  
   - T: ‚Üí `\\MSL-Laptop\PowerShellScripts`  
   - N: ‚Üí `\\MSL-Laptop\nyctaxi`  
   - I: ‚Üí `\\MSL-Laptop\ISOs`  

5. **Prepare cluster-capable storage**  
   Created virtual drives outside Hyper-V for SQLData, SQLLog, and SQLBackup.  

6. **Initialize and label shared disks**  
   Brought disks online, formatted, and assigned consistent letters (E:, F:, G:).  

7. **Audit and correlate disk mapping**  
   Ran scripts to validate ownership, drive letters, size, and eligibility across nodes.  

8. **Create WSFC cluster**  
   Established Windows Server Failover Cluster with NODE2 and NODE3 as members.  

9. **Run Test-Cluster validation**  
   Confirmed readiness of nodes, network, and storage prior to SQL installation.  

10. **Confirm disk/resource failover**  
    Moved clustered disks between NODE2 and NODE3 to validate online/offline behavior.  

11. **Checkpoint the environment**  
    Captured stable state (`LKGC-PreSQLServer`) as baseline before SQL install.  

12. **Prepare for SQL Server 2022 FCI**  
    Verified service accounts, privileges (e.g., Perform Volume Maintenance Tasks), and feature selection in readiness for installation.

## Step Sources

- [Failover clustering hardware requirements and storage options ‚Äì Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/failover-clustering/clustering-requirements)  
  Confirms WSFC native disk support expects **basic disks** (not dynamic) and recommends **NTFS**; a disk witness can be NTFS or ReFS.

- [Cluster Shared Volumes overview ‚Äì Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/failover-clustering/failover-cluster-csvs)  
  Explains that **CSV lets multiple nodes read/write the same LUN** and exposes a **consistent path under `C:\ClusterStorage`**; also notes **SQL Server FCI support begins with SQL Server 2014 (not 2012)**.

- [Always On failover cluster instances (SQL Server) ‚Äì Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/failover-clusters/windows/always-on-failover-cluster-instances-sql-server)  
  States an **FCI uses shared storage** (WSFC-managed) and that **only one node owns the resource group at a time**; FCIs **support CSV** and require **uniquely assigned disk drive letters**.

- [Create a failover cluster ‚Äì Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/failover-clustering/create-failover-cluster)  
  **Run validation before creating a cluster**; Microsoft support requires the complete configuration to pass validation.

- [Validate hardware for a failover cluster ‚Äì Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/high-availability/validate-hardware-failover-cluster)  
  Use **Validate a Configuration** or **Test-Cluster**; **rerun validation after changes** (adding nodes/storage). A **validation report is required** for Microsoft support; **two nodes** are needed to run all storage tests.

- [Test-Cluster (FailoverClusters) ‚Äì Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/failoverclusters/test-cluster?view=windowsserver2025-ps)  
  Runs hardware/network/storage validation; **storage tests won‚Äôt run on disks in use**‚Äîstop the clustered role or take disks offline first.

- [Move-ClusterGroup (FailoverClusters) ‚Äì Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/failoverclusters/move-clustergroup?view=windowsserver2025-ps)  
  **Moves a clustered role to another node** (common way to **simulate failover** and for maintenance preparation).

- [Suspend-ClusterNode (FailoverClusters) ‚Äì Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/failoverclusters/suspend-clusternode?view=windowsserver2025-ps)  
  **Pauses a node**; with **-Drain** it **gracefully moves workloads off** the node before maintenance (optionally to a specific **-TargetNode**).

- **Storage: Performance best practices for SQL Server on Azure VMs ‚Äì Microsoft Learn**  
  [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/windows/performance-guidelines-best-practices-storage?view=azuresql](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/windows/performance-guidelines-best-practices-storage?view=azuresql)  
  Recommends **formatting data disks with 64-KB allocation unit size**; marketplace SQL Server VMs default to 64-KB AU for data disks.

- **Database instant file initialization ‚Äì Microsoft Learn**  
  [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/databases/database-instant-file-initialization?view=sql-server-ver17](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/databases/database-instant-file-initialization?view=sql-server-ver17)  
  Enable IFI by granting **Perform volume maintenance tasks**; historically for **data files**, and **from SQL Server 2022** transaction **log autogrowth up to 64 MB** can benefit from IFI (TDE blocks data-file IFI but **not** the log-autogrowth behavior).

- [Manage Cluster Shared Volumes ‚Äì Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/failover-clustering/failover-cluster-manage-cluster-shared-volumes)  
  Management guidance for CSVs, including that you can **rename CSV volumes in `%SystemDrive%\ClusterStorage`** for clarity across nodes.
