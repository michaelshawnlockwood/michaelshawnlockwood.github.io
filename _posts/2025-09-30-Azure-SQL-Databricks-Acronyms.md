# Azure Migration & Databricks Acronyms Reference

A quick-reference guide to key Azure and data-engineering acronyms that recur throughout migration and modernization projects.

---

### **ADLS â€“ Azure Data Lake Storage**
Microsoftâ€™s cloud-based object storage optimized for analytics.  
Similar in concept to AWS S3 but supports a *hierarchical namespace* for directory-style organization and fine-grained ACLs.  
ðŸ”— https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction  

---

### **Azurite**
Microsoftâ€™s official **Azure Storage emulator** for local development and testing.  
It mimics Blob, Queue, and Table services so you can develop against Azure Storage APIs without an Azure account.  
ðŸ”— https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite  

---

### **MI â€“ Azure SQL Managed Instance**
A fully managed deployment of SQL Server in Azure offering near-100% feature parity with on-prem SQL Server.  
It automates patching, backups, and HA/DR while allowing instance-level control.  
ðŸ”— https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/  

---

### **MI Link â€“ Managed Instance Link**
A **distributed Availability Group (AG)** feature that provides near real-time replication from on-prem SQL Server to **Azure SQL Managed Instance**, enabling minimal-downtime migration or hybrid setups.  
ðŸ”— https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/managed-instance-link-overview

Supports both **offline** and **online (minimal downtime)** migrations with schema and data validation.  
ðŸ”— https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/dms/dms-overview  

---

### **CAF â€“ Cloud Adoption Framework**
Microsoftâ€™s **end-to-end guidance** for cloud adoption: strategy, planning, landing zones, governance, security, and operations.  
Provides reusable blueprints and policies for consistent cloud architecture.  
ðŸ”— https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/  

---

### **AHB â€“ Azure Hybrid Benefit**
A licensing program that lets organizations apply existing **Windows Server** or **SQL Server** licenses (with Software Assurance) to Azure resources.  
Reduces compute costs for **SQL Managed Instance**, **SQL Server on VMs**, and **Windows VMs**.  
ðŸ”— https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-hybrid-benefit/  

---

### **DBU â€“ Databricks Unit**
A unit of processing capability billed per second in **Azure Databricks**.  
Represents the compute cost for running workloads; total cost = DBUs Ã— instance hours Ã— pricing tier.
