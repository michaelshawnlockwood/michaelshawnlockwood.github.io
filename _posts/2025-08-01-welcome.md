Welcome! üéâ  

This is the very first entry on my technical blog. Instead of the generic ‚ÄúHello World,‚Äù I want to use this post to set the tone for what you‚Äôll find here.  

### Why I‚Äôm Writing
After 20+ years working with SQL Server‚Äîoften as the sole or senior DBA‚ÄîI‚Äôve collected a lot of stories, solutions, and lessons. Writing helps me sharpen my own thinking, and it creates a resource others can use.  

### What to Expect
- Deep dives into **performance tuning, automation, and SQL Server best practices**  
- Explorations in **PostgreSQL and open-source tooling** as I expand my skill set  
- Walkthroughs of side projects like **NYC Taxi data pipelines, Airflow + Databricks experiments, and Power BI**  
- Occasional reflections on **career, professionalism, and leadership** in the data space  

### Part of the Roadmap
This blog connects to the **roadmap** on my About page. Think of it as the ‚Äúfield notes‚Äù section‚Äîwhere I share progress and insights as I move along that journey.  

Thanks for stopping by. The best way to get value here is to check back as new articles appear. The next one will be a technical write-up you can actually use.
