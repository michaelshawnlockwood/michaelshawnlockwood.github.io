My lab environments: Hyper-V and Oracle VirtualBox VMs&mdash;Windows Server 2022 Failover Cluster (WSFC) - Datacenter Edition, SQL Server 2022 Failover Cluster Instances (FCIs) and Always On Availability Groups (AGs), openSuSE-Leap 15.6, Debian, and PostgreSQL. I keep all of this current.  
Full technology stacks, data lineage, and development cycles&mdash;ensuring that my skills and knowledge evolve, solutions stay articulable, reproducible, and fully prepared to ensure business continuity.  
At the same time, I expand into modern tech, including cloud infrastructure: Airflow, Databricks, and Azure. This is just multi-tasking
_GitHub Pages is where I articulate, document and publish achievements, guides, and runbooks._

# Professional Manifesto  
&mdash; _inspired by the book, "The Checklist Manifesto"_  
üéØ Thesis: Through continuous repetition, my core strengths, skills and knowdledge evolve, turning multiple platforms, cloud technologies, and programming languages into lasting elements of my Professional R√©pertoire.  
‚úÖ On a recurring quarterly cycle, I push boundaries and stress-test across the full data stack.  
‚úÖ Rebuild my environments using Hyper-V and Oracle VirtualBox (WSFC/SQL Server FCI and Linux/PostgreSQL), scripting for repeatability and documenting every step.  
‚úÖ Move and transform data with SSIS, Python, and PowerShell‚Äîleveraging SSIS for deep ETL and workflow control in the Microsoft stack, while Python and PowerShell provide flexible scripting, integration, and automation.  
‚è≥ Orchestrate end-to-end pipelines with Apache Airflow.  
üîç Deliver analysis and visuals through Power BI and D3.js.  
‚úÖ Expose data as JSON via .NET APIs (REST/GraphQL) to the consumption layer‚Äîweb clients (Angular, React), Analytics & BI (Power BI), and custom visualizations (D3.js).      
‚òÅÔ∏è Migrate workloads to cloud targets‚ÄîAzure and AWS S3‚Äîstaying aligned with evolving technology shifts.  
‚ö° Prioritize performance, transparency, and reproducibility, and always ensure outcomes are explainable and verifiable‚Äîalmost never quick-and-dirty.[^1]  
üìö Document and publish everything from steps to reconstruct to lessons learned in order to accelerate future builds and strengthen architecural knowledge.  
[^1]: In DevOps and production work, urgent business needs sometimes require quick fixes. The key is to recognize these as exceptions, document them, and follow up with proper regression and stress testing so long-term quality isn‚Äôt compromised.
