üß© Spark SQL in Context

Think of Spark SQL as the SQL interface and optimizer layer that sits on top of the Spark execution engine ‚Äî the part that actually distributes work across nodes.
When you use Databricks SQL, a Notebook cell with SELECT ‚Ä¶, or a Delta table query, you‚Äôre actually running through Spark SQL.

|Concept|What It Means Practically in Databricks|
|:--|:--|
|DataFrame API | Everything you run via SQL has an equivalent DataFrame representation. When you call spark.read.table('healthcare.phi.patient'), it returns a distributed DataFrame.|
|Catalyst Optimizer | Spark‚Äôs ‚Äúbrain.‚Äù It rewrites and optimizes query plans before execution ‚Äî combining filters, pushing down predicates, and generating efficient JVM or C++ code. Photon (the vectorized engine) sits just below this.|
|Schema on Read | Why Databricks can query your CSV, Parquet, or Delta files directly from ADLS or S3 without ‚Äúimporting‚Äù them. Schema is inferred or declared, then applied at runtime.|
|Integration | You can mix SQL with Python, R, or Scala logic inside the same job ‚Äî for example, a SQL step to join datasets followed by a PySpark ML model training step.|
|Performance | In Databricks, Spark SQL benefits from Catalyst + Photon (C++ vectorized engine), so your SQL behaves more like a high-performance database query than a typical script.|
