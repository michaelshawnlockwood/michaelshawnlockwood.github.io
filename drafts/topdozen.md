___Ranked by Criticality to Business Continuity___

1. Backups & verified restores
➝ Absolute foundation. Without reliable, tested restores, every other control is moot.

2. HA/DR posture
➝ Keeps the lights on in real time. FCI/AGs are what allow uptime continuity while backups protect against catastrophic loss.

3. Incidents
➝ Fast, consistent incident response ensures that continuity gaps (outages, degradations) are quickly detected, triaged, and remediated.

4. Observability
➝ Detecting drift, bottlenecks, and anomalies before they become outages is a continuity safeguard.

5. Performance
➝ Sustained responsiveness is essential for _continuity_ of the user experience; without performance, systems may technically be up but practically unusable.

6. Security
➝ A breach or ransomware attack can halt continuity as surely as hardware failure. Security preserves trust and availability.

7. ETL reliability
➝ Ensures continuity of data pipelines feeding critical systems, not just the databases themselves.

8. Release pipeline
➝ Controls change risk, a major cause of downtime. Healthy release practices are proactive continuity defense.

9. Capacity & cost
➝ Prevents “quiet failures” (running out of storage, throttling, overspending leading to cutbacks) that jeopardize continuity.

10. Compliance & governance
➝ Regulatory continuity — staying in business by not failing audits, fines, or losing the right to process sensitive data.

11. Standards & practices
➝ Keeps teams aligned, prevents anti-patterns from creeping in that could erode reliability over time.

12. Documentation & knowledge transfer
➝ The continuity of people and process knowledge. Essential for resilience but depends on the higher layers being in place first.
