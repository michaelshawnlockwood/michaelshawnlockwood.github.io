## What p95 means and why it’s useful.
  __Definition:__ The 95th percentile is the value below which 95% of observations fall (and 5% are slower). It captures tail latency without being hijacked by outliers like an average can.
            
  - Averages hide spikes; p50 (median) tells you the “typical” request but misses pain.
  - p95 catches the real user pain while staying steadier than p99 (which can be noisy on low volume).
            
## What to track at p95
 - Query/endpoint duration (OLTP, API endpoints, or critical reports).
 - Wait-time families (e.g., lock/latch/IO waits) as p95 per wait type.
 - I/O latencies by data/log file or storage tier.
 - Blocking duration and deadlock rate (p95 + counts).
 - Throughput alongside p95 (requests/sec), so you see load + tail together.
            
## How to use it in practice
**Service Level Indicator (SLI)**
  The measured metric. e.g., p95 query latency, success rate, error rate, freshness.
**Service Level Objective (SLO)**
 - The target for an SLI over a window. e.g., “p95 query latency < 200 ms during 9–5 ET, 99% of requests over the last 28 days.”  
  ***Examples:***
 - OLTP: “p95 query latency < 200 ms during business hours.”
 - Night ETL: “p95 step duration < 5 s; no step > p99=20 s.”
 - Windows: last 15m, 1h, 24h, and 28d, with deploy markers to correlate regressions.
 - Breakdowns: by database, application name, and endpoint/proc to localize issues fast.
 - Pair signals: p95 + volume + error rate (Apdex-like view) to avoid chasing ghosts.

**Service Level Agreement (SLA)**
External commitment/contract (often with penalties) that’s usually derived from your SLOs.
